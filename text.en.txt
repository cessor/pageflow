2. Experiment (:annotation)
===========================
Here you can see a function, written in C#. *Don't freak out!*.
The code is commented. The purpose of the function is stated in the first comment line. The other lines contain an overview of the variables, that occur in the code.

3. Your Task (:annotation)
=============================
Your task here is to find an error in the code.
The code is compiling correclty, but it is producing a faulty behavior during runtime. The function contains only one error.

4. Frame (:annotation)
======================
During the experiment there are only a couple of lines visible whilst the remaining lines are hidden. You can move the visible area using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

11. Procedure
=============
You will see a total of $number different codes. Each addresses a different problem. You can take a short break during the trials, each of which will take approximately 5 - 10 minutes.

12. Summary
===========
To sum things up:
 \- Find the runtime error
 \- Move the visible area with your arrow keys
 \- Press the space bar when you found the error
